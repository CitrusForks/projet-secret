Here is a small demo (it  cannot  qualify as intro in
regards of its size) that was completely coded in C.

The only originality of this production comes from its
extensive  use  of  the  Graphics.library. All that is
shown  on  screen  (scrolling,  copper list,  bobs...)
uses API system calls.

                No Hardware Register
                 were harmed during
              the coding of this demo.
