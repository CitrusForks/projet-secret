This demo requires an Amiga 500, with at least 1 Meg
of RAM, or any faster configuration.
Tested on OCS, ECS, AGA, with an 68000, 020, 030,
using the kickstart/ROMs 1.2, 1.3, 2.0.1 and 3.0.

The only originality of this production comes from its
extensive  use  of  the  Graphics.library. All that is
shown  on  screen  (scrolling,  copper list,  bobs...)
uses API system calls.

                No Hardware Register
                 were harmed during
              the coding of this demo.
